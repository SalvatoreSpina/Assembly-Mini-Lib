# Assembly mini lib

A small project where I recoded some basic C fuctions, like strlen or srtcmp, but in Assembly. Yeah, fun.

## Why?

I started binary reverse engineering and I found myself kinda struggling reading Assembly code. So, to understand how this language works, why not coding something?
Plus, low level language is always super interesting.
